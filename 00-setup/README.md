# Setup

Let's do some basic setup for the Sockets with Node.js lab.

There are two files in every lab:

  - `client.js`
  - `server.js`

In each lab these files will contain progress from the previous lab. In this lab they are empty.

## Starting your terminal sessions

In labs 1-3 you will open at least two terminal sessions (preferrably a single window with two vertically split panes).

In the first terminal, start the Node.js REPL with:

```
node -r ./path/to/client
```

This is now your client session.

In the second terminal start the Node.js REPL with:

```
node -r ./path/to/server
```

This is now your server session.
